Windows Command Prompt Maze Game

## About
I wrote this game back in elementary school in 2012 when I was first learning how to program. I was so proud to discover the choice command on Windows, as it meant I could create a "real" videogame in command prompt. This was my first attempt to create such a game. I hope that you enjoy.

*Note: For this game to work, you MUST have the choice.exe command installed on your Windows machine*
